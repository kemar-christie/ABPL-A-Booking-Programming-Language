# üéüÔ∏è ABPL ‚Äì A Booking Programming Language

<br>

## Description
ABPL (A Booking Programming Language) is a domain-specific language designed to facilitate natural-language-style ticket booking operations. Developed in Python using the PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) toolkit, ABPL interprets user-friendly source code to simulate real-world actions such as booking, confirming, paying for, and cancelling tickets for various events and transport options.

This project was created as part of the CIT4004: Analysis of Programming Languages course at the University of Technology, Jamaica (Semester 2, 2024/2025). We have decided to take it to the next level by implementing changes and updates to this program.
