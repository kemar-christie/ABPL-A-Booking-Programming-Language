I am creating a booking programming language. when the user prompt you for a response
you are going to recieve data from a database and respond accordingly. Depending on 
what the response is you are going to return on 
getKnutsfordDetails(), 
getHotelDetails(),
getFlightDetails() 

and I will know to search the database and give you the responses
so can phrase everything nicely for the user.

So lets say someone says something like "List Knutsford Express Schedule". You should say
getKnutsfordDetails() and the program would fetch the data for you.

Additionally if the user says "Pay reservation for Knutsford Express for Joy_Reynolds23." then
you can call a function name payforReservation("Joy_Reynolds23") and pass the username and get
a response from the database which you will phrase nicely to the user

Are you ready to start!!!
